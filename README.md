# A High Step-Up Nonisolated DC–DC Converter With Low Voltage Stress Across Transistor

This repository contains Altium Designer files for the printed circuit board (PCB) of the proposed high step-up nonisolated DC–DC converter as presented in the paper:  
**"A High Step-Up Nonisolated DC–DC Converter With Low Voltage Stress Across Transistor."**

## Abstract

The proposed converter topology utilizes a combination of a coupled inductor and voltage multiplier cells (VMCs) to achieve ultrahigh voltage gain with lower duty cycles. The secondary side of the coupled inductor works with VMCs to suppress peak voltages across the power switches, minimizing voltage stress on the semiconductors. Key advantages include:  
- **Continuous input current with reduced ripple.**  
- **Ultrahigh voltage gain.**  
- **Low voltage stress across semiconductors.**  

This work includes a detailed analysis of the converter’s operational modes, steady-state performance, design considerations, and comparisons with similar topologies.  

An experimental prototype was constructed to validate the proposed system, featuring:  
- **Power rating:** 240 W  
- **Input voltage range:** 14–60 V  
- **Output voltage:** 350 V  
- **Switching frequency:** 60 kHz  

The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the converter.
